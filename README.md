# nonbinarytobinary
This program takes the words "one" and "zero" to their respective numbers and disregards any other numeric input <br />

This is version one of a small project to test out my skills in C#. <br />

Plans for this code in the future are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Improving the program looping with a better boolean placement</li>
<li>Limiting the amount of words that are in the string and having the program loop if the user exceeds the set number</li>
<li>Cleaning up the appearance of the code, condencing a few lines of code down if they can be condenced.</li>
</ul>
